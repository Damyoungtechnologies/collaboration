We incorporated a very simple email message API to enable any client or potential hiring manager that visits the website to write us a email for any enquiry. We also added the ability for anyone that visits the site to be able to download our resumes to their device(s). We chose the template specifically because it appeared simple and looked like something we could finish building the website before the deadline, which we were able to achieve building the website before the deadline was reached.
